# Data-Ingest-Scripts
Repository containing mostly python scripts for wrangling PubMed NXML files

PubMedParser.py is the script to run
loadArticles.py currently just tests the ability to load the numpy dump created by the parser

The structure of the BioMed folder shows the folder structure the script expects. In practice, there will be alot more articles when unpacking the pubmed archives
